My soluttion to The Odin's Project Etch a Skettch section. A project that taught me how to dynamically create and manipulate elements using Javascript instead of creating them by using HTML.After completing this project i became more familiar with DOM events and methods by manipulating css styles with javascript and by implementing events like addEventListener  etc.
